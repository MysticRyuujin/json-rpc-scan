# Copy this file to config.yaml and modify as needed

# List of Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoints to compare
# Note: Client type is auto-detected from web3_clientVersion
# The 'name' field is only used as a fallback if detection fails
endpoints:
  - name: Geth
    url: http://localhost:8545
    # Optional: Add custom headers
    # headers:
    #   Authorization: Bearer <token>

  - name: Nethermind
    url: http://localhost:8546

  # Supported clients: Geth, Nethermind, Erigon, Besu, Reth, Nimbus, Ethrex
  # Unknown clients are also supported (all methods/tracers assumed available)

# Optional: Global settings
# settings:
#   timeout: 30  # Request timeout in seconds
#   concurrent_requests: 10  # Max concurrent requests

# Optional: Compatibility overrides
# Use these to customize which methods/tracers are tested, regardless of
# the built-in client compatibility matrix
#
# This is useful for:
# - Testing unknown/custom clients that don't match known patterns
# - Skipping methods that are known to be broken or slow
# - Force-testing methods that the tool thinks aren't supported
compatibility:
  # Methods to always skip (even if client reports support)
  # skip_methods:
  #   - debug_traceCall  # Skip if this method is too slow or broken

  # Tracers to always skip (even if client reports support)
  # Use "structLogger" for the default opcode logger (no tracer)
  # skip_tracers:
  #   - prestateTracer  # Skip prestate tracer tests
  #   - 4byteTracer     # Skip 4byte tracer tests

  # Methods to force-enable (even if client doesn't report support)
  # force_methods:
  #   - debug_traceTransaction  # Force test even if marked unsupported

  # Tracers to force-enable (even if client doesn't report support)
  # force_tracers:
  #   - callTracer  # Force test callTracer even on Besu
